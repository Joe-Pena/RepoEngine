## RepoEngine

Hello, this is the assignment for you all, at first I went with your typical search API app, which relied on state to get the input value and fetch data from the API. However, I decided to change it and make it rely on the URL for the input. That way you could share a search, and the component would get the state needed from the query params of the URL.

## Cloning the application

First, clone the application.

`gh repo clone Joe-Pena/RepoEngine`

If you don't use the new Github CLI (I highly recommend it!), then clone through SSH or HTTPS, whichever you typically use.

### HTTPS

`https://github.com/Joe-Pena/RepoEngine.git`

### SSH

`git@github.com:Joe-Pena/RepoEngine.git`

## Running the application

`npm install`

afterwards, run the following command:

`npm start`
